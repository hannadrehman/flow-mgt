To do this, you can setup the equation: 4.7T kWh NA consumption / 20% of world share = 23.5T kWh worldwide consumption. Next, you'll want to use the growth rate shortcut to estimate consumption after 5 years at a 2% CAGR. Thus, the equation is: 23.5T kWh * (1 + 2%) ^ 5. This simplifies to: 23.5T * ~1.1 = 25.9T kWh."

      "explanation": "To answer this question, start by setting up an equation to estimate how many passengers your client will handle annually in 6 years. This can be setup as follows: 100M passengers * (1 + 2% growth rate) ^ 6 years. Using the growth rate simplification, we can simplify this to: 100M * ~1.12 = ~112M passengers. Thus, we'll have 12M additional passengers the client needs to serve: ~112M \u2013 100M. Now, we can determine the number of aircraft needed with the following equation: 12M additional passengers / 500K capacity per aircraft. Thus, the client needs 24 additional aircraft."

Future market size: $330M * (1 + 5%) ^ 4 = $330M * ~120% = $396M.

First, you need to establish the total market size, including the advertising business. Thus, total market = $1.2B / 1/3 = $3.6B. Now, determine the profit the client is expected to make annually. To do this, you must first calculate their revenues based on market share and then calculate their absolute margin. Client revenues are $3.6B * 5% of the market = $180M. Client profit is $180M revenues * 10% margin = $18M. Finally, to break even: $50M / $18M = 2.7 years"

This reduces to: 110% * 95% = 104.5%. If you struggle with that math, you can convert it into fractions and reduce. Thus, you'd have 110/100 * 95/100. This simplifies to: 11/10 * 19/20 = 209/200.

First, set up the market math equation for total market size: 151.8M / 20%, which can be re-written as roughly 150M * 5. Next, you want to account for the market growth, so: 750M * 1.03. 1% of 750M is 7.5M, so 103% of 750M is 772.5M."

      "question": "Right now, your client holds about a 6% share of the credit card market in China. After their planned expansion, if they're able to grow to own 10% market share of the 145B in transactions, and the average transaction size is $15, about how much is their dollar transaction volume?",
      "options": [
        "$200B",

        "$260B",
        "$280B"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "To solve for this, you need to complete two steps. First, calculate the number of transactions they process. Then, multiply the transactions against the expected value per transaction. Thus, 145B total transactions * 10% client share = 14.5B transactions annually. For total volume, the equation is: 14.5B txns * $15 per txn. This can be rounded to simplify the math: 15B * $15 = $225B. Since we rounded the number of transactions up by roughly ~3%, we know the true answer will be roughly 3% below $225B. Thus, $220B is the best answer."
