        detailedDescription:
            'DRUG CASE OVERVIEW <br/> Today, we are going to discuss the case of a pharmaceutical company based in the U.S. The client has developed a new drug, PrevenT (Prevent Thrombosis), that helps reduce the rate at which a particular complication of hip-replacement surgery, deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), occurs. <br/>What you need to know is that DVT can lead to very serious medical conditions, including higher risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) or major bleeding. <br/>PrevenT will directly compete against Clearvenax, an established product that is also used to reduce rates of DVT and hence DVT-related complications. Clearvenax is sold at $4 per dose and has a variable production cost of $1 per dose. The client has asked you to help set a suitable price for PrevenT. <br/>',
